# Final Synthesis: The Core Shift

| Metric | Legacy Engineering | AI-Native Engineering |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Goal** | Minimize human keystrokes | **Maximize context density** |
| **Logic** | Implicit / Clever | **Explicit / Verbose** |
| **Structure** | Horizontal Layers | **Vertical Slices** |
| **Architecture** | Static Diagrams | **Executable Physics** |
| **Memory** | Tribal Knowledge | **Journals & Intent** |

## What This Means in Practice

AI-native engineering is not “use AI more.” It is “change the system so intelligence can operate reliably.”

The core moves are:
- Replace guesswork with deterministic conventions.
- Replace policy with enforceable constraints.
- Replace tribal knowledge with written intent.
- Replace “FAIL” with feedback that teaches.

## The Two Metrics That Matter

1. **Context density**: does the agent’s working set contain the truth, or noise?
2. **Mechanical predictability**: can the agent compute the correct action without guessing?

If you improve these two, everything else gets easier.

## Scorecard (Self‑Assessment)

Answer these quickly:

- Can you predict file paths from tasks without searching?
- Does `MAP.md` explain the architecture and red zones clearly?
- Are critical invariants written where the agent will see them (intent headers/tests)?
- Does CI enforce at least a few architecture/convention laws?
- Are test failures written as fix instructions?
- Are diffs small enough for reliable review?

If you answered “no” to more than two, your next step is not “more autonomy.”
Your next step is to tighten structure and feedback.
